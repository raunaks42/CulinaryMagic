            <h2>Amrita Sengupta</h2>
            <p>An IT professional with a flair of cooking!</p>
            <p>Being a working woman for 20 long years of my life has never taken away the love for food and the creativity involved in the process of food preparation. The comfort and satisfaction derived from home food is just uncomparable to any kind of multicuisine dishes which are available either in plush restaurants or any online food delivery.</p>
            <p>With this website, I have tried to put down some of my favourites on the menu and art of planning and organizing, so that no matter how busy you are, you will always want to go back to ways of getting food prepared at the comfort of your home. Yes! I strongly recommend … whether you do all the cooking yourself or employ a help for it … a small personalized thought into the whole process will make all the difference to your everyday life. </p>
